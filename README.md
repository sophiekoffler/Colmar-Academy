Colmar Academy was the capstone project from Codeacademy's Pro Intensive, Build Websites from Scratch. The site is a landing page for a fictitious university and illustrates skills learned in the course which was an introduction to front end develpment focusing mainly on html and css. The layout was constructed with flexbox and overall the project demonstrates my ability to deliver a project to spec. The specs can be found on my github account.
